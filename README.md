   ## Steps to use the code
   
    1) Follow the steps in the following link to download Flutter and the IDE that you prefer. Make sure you have Android 
    
    Studio so that you can use the emulator. I have used VSCode but feel free to use whatever suits you best.
    
    https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   
    2) After setting up the environment, you can download the zip file. You should unzip the file that you have downloaded. 
    
    Then open the file at the IDE you prefer.
    
    3) After opening the file, you must update the plugins and dependencies that i have stated above. Flutter gets updated so quickly so make sure that you update.
    
    To update both the Flutter SDK and the packages that your app depends on, use the flutter upgrade command from the root of your app.

	"flutter upgrade"
    
    4) After you open the file, make sure you open the source file in the Android Studio too.
    
    5) After all, open the terminal and write this command: 
    
	"flutter run"
    
    6) I hope it all works well, enjoy the CampActivities app!
